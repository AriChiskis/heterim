Here is all the data of the streets that have been scanned. For every street that has been scanned, there is a folder under its name with the following details:

1. **even** = even pictures of every even address
2. **odd** = odd pictures of every odd address
3. **shape.png** = a picture that describes the curve of the street, how it is constructed geometrically
4. **inquiries.csv** = all the data on the inquiries for each address (number, piece of land) on the street
